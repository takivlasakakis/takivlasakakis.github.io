	<h1> I speak Greek and am interested in teaching my sons how to speak Greek. This page will be dedicated to teaching the Greek language.</h1>
		<p>I learned Greek through my parents. I will continue this tradition with my sons. I have two sons named Alexandros and Pericles. I think it's very important to carry on the tradition.</p>

	<h2>Why speak Greek?</h2>
	<p>No real good reason, honestly. There are roughly only 25 million speakers worldwide. I just want to pass on Greek culture.</p>

	<p>I believe very strongly in learning greek.</p>
<ol>
	<li>It excersizes the mind</li>
	<li>Keeps people in touch with their culture</li>
	<li>Is a great conversation starter!</li>
</ol>
 	<p>This website <a href="http://www.greekpod101.com/"> www.greekpod101.com </a> is great for learning greek. This site is good because it includes video's of native speakers of Greek. You can hear the language spoken. The website provides a multitude of services, such as a community forum, smartphone applications, and live hosts. I cannot provide that yet.
